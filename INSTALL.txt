1. Introduction
======================================================================

Their are two versions of the plugin.

    * the GMS-2.X version, which is build using Visual Studio 2008
      and obviously requires the DMSDK for GMS 2.X

    * the GMS-1.X version, which is build using Visual Studio 2003
      and obviously requires the DMSDK for GMS 1.X (aka DMSDK382)

For the DMSDKs contact Gatan or look on their website www.gatan.com.

2. Prerequisites
======================================================================

The DMSDK must running work (examples will compile), so any prerequisites
for the DMSDK (e.g. boost) must be properly installed.

The plugin depends on some 3rdparty libraries (for example the HDF5 library...).
These must be separately downloaded and unpacked or linked to the directory
names mentioned below

Required libraries:
    utfcpp
        * see http://utfcpp.sourceforge.net
        * version 2.3.1A was used for building the plugin
        * unpack to 3rdparty/utfcpp
    
    zlib
        * see http://zlib.org
        * version 1.2.8 was used for building the plugin
        * unpack to 3rdparty/zlib
        
    szip
        * see http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5
        * version version 2.1 was used for building the plugin
        * unpack to 3rdparty/szip
        * As there are special licensing issues with this library, the 
          compression is disabled by the build instructions below. The 
          decompression has no licensing problems.
        
    hdf5
        * see http//www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5
        * Version 1.8.8 was used for the GMS-2.X plugin
        * Version 1.8.3 was used for the GMS-1.X plugin, due to the needed 
          VS2003 support)
        * unpack to 3rdparty/hdf5
 
3. Building
======================================================================

    3.1 Build zlib
    --------------------------------------------------------------

    This can be done from the Visual Studio command prompt. Go to the 
    3rdparty/zlib directory and execute either
        nmake -f win32/Makefile.msc LOC="-DASMV -DASMINF" OBJA="inffas32.obj match686.obj"
    or
        nmake -f win32/Makefile.msc

    3.2 Build szip
    --------------------------------------------------------------

    For GMS-1.X:
    * Copy the vc2003/szip_static_vs2003.vcproj file to 3rdparty/szip/window/static
    * Open the 3rdparty/szip/windows/static/szip_static_vs2003.vcproj in Visual Studio 2003.

    For GMS-2.X:
    * Open the 3rdparty/szip/windows/static/szip_static.vcproj in Visual Studio 2008.
    
    The following steps are for both versions:
    * Remove line "#define HAVE_ENCODING" in SZconfig.h
    * Build the Release build

    3.3 Build hdf5
    --------------------------------------------------------------
    
    * Set up environment variables
        HDF5_EXT_ZLIB=YOURDIR\3rdparty\zlib\zlib.lib
        HDF5_EXT_SZIB=YOURDIR\3rdparty\szib\windows\static\lib\Win32\Release\libszip.lib
    * Call windows\copy_hdf.bat
    * For GMS-1.X: Open windows_vnet\proj\all\all.sln with Visual Studio 2003
      For GMS-2.X: Open windows\proj\all\all.sln with Visual Studio 2008
    * In Visual Studio add to the include directories (in Tools/Options/Projects and Solutions/VC++ Directories)
        3rdparty\zlib
        3rdparty\szib\src   
    * IMPORTANT: In the "Release" configuration of the projects hdf5 set the Runtime Library (under
      C/C++/Code Generation) to Multi-threaded DLL (/MD).
    * Build the hdf5 project (Release build).

    3.4 Build the plugin
    --------------------------------------------------------------

    GMS-2.X:
    * Open vc2008/hdf5_plugin.vcproj with Visual Studio 2008
    * Add your DMSDK include and library directories to the VC++ Directories 
      in Visual Studio (in Tools/Options/Projects and Solutions/VC++ Directories). The
      DMSDK is usally installed to C:\ProgramData\Gatan\DMSDK. Also the include
      path to the boost library is needed.
    * Build the Release build
    * You should find your plugin as vc2008/Release/hdf5_plugin.dll

    GMS-1.X:
    * Open vc2003/hdf5_plugin.vcproj with Visual Studio 2003
    * Add your DMSDK include and library directories to the VC++ Directories 
      in Visual Studio (in Tools/Options/Projects/VC++ Directories). 
    * Build the Release build
    * You should find your plugin as vc2003/Release/hdf5_GMS1X_x86.dll

    3.5 Building the documentation
    --------------------------------------------------------------

    The documentation requires the Sphinx Python tool (www.sphinx-doc.org).
    With Sphinx/Python properly installed, simply change into the doc
    directory and execute
        make WHATEVER
    to produce the documentation in the desired format. Call make 
    without an argument to see a list of possible formats.
    
    Tested with Sphinx version 1.3
    
4. Testing
======================================================================

To run the tests, the unittest.s (in tests/unittest) script must be installed in DigitalMicrograph.
Follow the instruction accompanied with the script for installation.

The tests access some test data files, which are also in the tests directory. In order to 
know that directory under DigitalMicrograph the tests must be immediately run after loading
them into DigitalMicrograph. Otherwise the directory may not be discoverable anymore.

The tests are designed to succeed under GMS-2.X. Under GMS-1.X some magic numbers and functionality
is different. To run change the arguments of the following calls
    
    # Current directory
    GMS-2.X: GetApplicationDirectory(0, 0)
    GMS-1.X: GetApplicationDirectory(2, 0)

    # Temporary directory
    GMS-2.X: GetApplicationDirectory(6, 0)
    GMS-1.X: GetApplicationDirectory(3, 0)

A known issue is that the handling of packed complex data is different and currently only works under GMS 2.X.

5. Install
======================================================================

The Visual Studio project files are designed to produce different outputs, depending on the
combination of target GMS version and platform. The plugins produced are:

    GMS-1.X (32 bit): vc2008\Release\hdf5_GMS1X_x86.dll
    GMS-2.X (32 bit): vc2008\Release\hdf5_GMS2X_x86.dll
    GMS-2.X (64 bit): vc2008\x64\Release\hdf5_GMS2X_amd64.dll

For installation simply copy the correct DLL file into the plugin directory of your Digital
Micrograph installation. By default these are:

    GMS-2.X: c:\ProgramData\Gatan\Plugins
    GMS-1.X: c:\Program Files\Gatan\DigitalMicrograph\Plugins
